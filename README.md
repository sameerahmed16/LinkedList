# LinkedList
This is a C++ program that demonstrates the management and manipulation of a singly linked list, implementing several fundamental operations essential for linked list functionality. The program defines a Node class, representing elements of the linked list, where each node contains an integer data field and a pointer to the next node.

Key operations implemented in the program include:
Insertion: Adds new nodes to the linked list at specified positions.
Deletion: Removes nodes from specific positions or those containing a specific value, adjusting links appropriately to maintain list integrity.
Display: Outputs the contents of the linked list to the console, showing current node values in sequence.
Get Length: Returns the number of nodes in the linked list, demonstrating traversal capabilities.
Get Element: Retrieves the data value of a node at a specified position, illustrating how to navigate through the list.
Creating a List from Array: Constructs a new linked list from a given array of integers, showcasing list initialization and dynamic memory allocation.
